## Takeaways from Training on a Simple Dataset

1. **Perfect Linear Relationships are Easy to Model**
   - When the dataset is small, clean, and follows a linear relationship, a simple linear regression model can quickly learn to map inputs to outputs.  
   - This results in a very low loss, sometimes nearing zero, because the model perfectly predicts the target values.

2. **Overfitting to Small Datasets**
   - For small datasets, the model can "memorize" the exact mapping, leading to overfitting. While this is acceptable for simple experiments, it highlights the importance of using larger or more complex datasets in real-world scenarios.

3. **Importance of Noise and Complexity**
   - Real-world datasets often have noise or non-linear relationships. Adding complexity to your dataset makes the model's training and evaluation more realistic.

4. **Training Epochs Should Match Complexity**
   - For simple datasets, training for fewer epochs is sufficient. Overtraining can waste resources without providing additional benefits.

5. **Validation is Key**
   - Using a validation set can help measure how well the model generalizes to unseen data, ensuring it doesnâ€™t just memorize the training set.

## Lessons for Future Experiments
- Start simple, but always think about how to increase dataset complexity to challenge your model.
- Use the insights from small experiments to understand how PyTorch models behave before tackling more complex datasets or architectures.
